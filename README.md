# Bonsai

A starter project for Roots stack and Bonsai CLI that automatically detects and configures your environment based on your project structure.

## Overview

This project intelligently checks whether you're using:
- **Radicle** (Roots' paid all-in-one solution) or
- **Open-source Roots stack** (Sage 11, Bedrock, and Trellis)

## What It Does

Bonsai provides a one-shot setup that:
1. Provisions a local development environment using Trellis and Lima VM
2. Sets up a Sage 11 theme with proper configuration
3. Uses Bonsai CLI to build a fully functional web app ready to use out of the box
4. Configures proper SSH and host settings for seamless local development
